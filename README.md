### Assignment Analysis:

  - Chance of campaign success is inversely proportional to goal amount (greater the Goal, the chance of its success goes down).
  - Theater, Music, Technology, Film & Video (FV) make up 86% of the successful campaigns (78% overall).
  - Every Music-Rock, FV-Documentary, and Technology-Hardware campaign was successful.
  - Every Journalism campaign is canceled.
 #### 2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - No “backers_count” detail within each campaign to better understand individual contributors to each campaign.
  - Reason-category on why a Kickstarter campaign failed or canceled.
 #### 3.What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - Percentage of sub-category within each parent category
  - Pareto chart of each parent category with sub-category showing which has greatest influence overall (within its parent)
